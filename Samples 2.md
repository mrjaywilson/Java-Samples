## Samples 2
### Area of Coordinates
Prompts the user to enter three points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3) of a triangle and displays its area.
### Average Acceleration
Obtains average acceleration based on time and velocity.
### Calculate BMI
Prompts the user to enter a weight in pounds and  height in inches and displays the BMI.
### Calculate Interest
Reads the balance and the annual percentage interest rate and  displays the interest for the next month.
### Calculate Minimum Runway
Prompts the user to enter v in meters/second (m/s) and the  acceleration 'a' in meters/second squared (m/s2), and displays the minimum runway length needed for takeoff.
### Calculate Temperature
Reads a Celsius degree in a double value from the console, then converts it to Fahrenheit and displays the result.
### Calculate Windchill
Prompts the user to enter a temperature between -58F and 41F and a wind speed greater than or equal to 2 and displays the wind-chill temperature.
### Compute Change (dollars and cents)
Fixes the possible loss of accuracy when converting a double value to an int value. Enters the input as an integer whose last two digits represent the cents.
### Compute Check
Calculates a given gratuity into a given subtota
### Compute Savings Value
Prompts the user to enter a monthly saving amount and displays the account value after the sixth month.
### Compute Volume
Reads in the radius and length of a cylinder and computes the area and volume using the following formulas:
* area = radius * radius * pi
* volume = area * length
### Convert Feet
Reads a number in feet, converts it to meters, and displays the result.
### Convert Grams
Converts pounds into kilograms.
### Convert Minutes
Converts minutes into years and days. For simplicity, assumes all years have 365 days.
### Current Time
Obtains the current time based on a given time zone offset.
### Distance Between Points
Prompts the user to enter two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) and displays their distance between them.
### Energy To Heat
Calculates the amount of energy needed to heat water from an initial temperature to a final temperature.
### Fuel Cost
Prompts the user to enter the distance to drive, the fuel efficiency of the car in miles per gallon, and the price per gallon, and displays the cost of the trip.
### Future Investment Value
Reads in investment amount, annual interest rate, and number of years, and displays the future investment value.
### Hexagon Area
Prompts the user to enter the side of a hexagon and displays its area.
### Population Projection
Projects the population for number of years input by user. Assumes a year only has 365 days.
### Power Table
Displays a table of powers. Casts floating-point numbers into integers.

| a | b | pow(a, b) |
|:------|:-------|:----------|
|1|2|1|
|2|3|8|
|3|4|81|
|4|5|1024|
|5|6|15625|

### Sum Digits
Sums all the digits together of a single number.
